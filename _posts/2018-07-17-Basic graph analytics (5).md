## K-means clustering for figuring out a shape of community 

When analyzing a graph, the shape of the network can be the most dimensionally distinct element of fraud.

In fact, first, we check the shape of the network and then proceed with a detailed analysis of the individual nodes in the network.

Is there any alternative way we only use the minimun human resources to analyze the shape of network graph?

So I used these processes to figure out the shape of communities in the entire network.Â 

1. Apply Modularity

2. Measure the shape of community by 

    - Eigenvector centrality -
  
    - Density - 
  
    - Average of clustering coefficient -
  
    - Average of shortest path length -
  
    - Diameter - 
  
    - Robin Alexander Clustering  -

3. Apply k-means clustering
