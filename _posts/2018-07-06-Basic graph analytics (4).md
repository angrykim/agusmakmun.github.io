Today, let's talk about a more advanced topic of graph analysis.

I talked about graph analysis in the previous post.

But if one graph is linked to another graph and this graph represents the entire data, 

will the Graph analysis method we have discussed so far apply effectively? 

Is this huge graph a fraud? 

Which Node is the most effective to detect?

We need to reduce the size of the indirectly connected network. and that for we use Modularity to divide the network units into community units. 

(One more thing, with modularity, You will be able to generate a way to automate graph analysis.)
